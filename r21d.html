  In this architecture, 3D convolution is broken down into 2D and 1D convolution. 2D convolution is in
spatial dimension and 1D convolution is along the temporal
dimension. <br>There are two benefits of this decomposition:
<ol>
<li> Increase in non-linearity as the number of layers have
increased
<li>Due to factorization of 3D kernels, the
optimization becomes easier.
</ol>
