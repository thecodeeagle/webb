  This network employs skip
  connections like ResNet architecture in contrast to version
  1. It helps the model in faster training and to build deeper
  networks. There are also linear bottlenecks present in the
  middle of layers. It helps in two ways as we reduce the
  number of input channels:
  <ol>
    <li> With depthwise convolution,
  the model size is reduced
  <li> At inference time, memory
  usage is low. V2 denotes version 2 of mobilenet and 1.0X
  uses the original parameter settings.
</ol>
